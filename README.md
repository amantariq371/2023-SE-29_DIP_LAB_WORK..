Color Channel Analysis and Binary Conversion (Task 01)

This Python program performs color channel analysis and intensity conversions on a user-uploaded colored image. It separates the image into its Red, Green, and Blue components, creates a grayscale version, and generates a binary image using thresholding. All versions, including the original image, individual color channels, grayscale, and binary images, are displayed side by side for visual comparison. This allows users to study color distribution, analyze intensity variations, and understand the effect of thresholding on image segmentation.

Libraries: OpenCV, Matplotlib
